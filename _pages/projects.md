**Mobile Biometric Data Enrolment Unit**  

 <p align="center">![Mobile Enrolment Unit](/images/mobile_unit.jpg)</p>

I designed a Mobile Biometric Data Enrolment Unit from scratch through several iterations. A total of over 50 units have been developed and deployed so far for the capturing or enrolling of biometric and biodata of applicants of Ghanaian and Liberian passports around the world including most of their embassies. These units have all the components required, namely a laptop, fingerprint scanner, camera, tripod, signature pad, centralised power supply, receipt printer and document scanner, all in one Pelican case with one external power plug powering all the items in the case. Extensive research was done on which components could work together, their specifications and their sizes relative to the total size available in the case. A number of custom foams have been designed with 3D CAD software depending on the specific types of the above equipment in a given unit and are custom cut to hold the equipment safely in the case.
