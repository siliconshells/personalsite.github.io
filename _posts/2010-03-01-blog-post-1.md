These were captured when we did the first official enrolment after transitioning from paper based Passport administration process to the new fully electronic administration process. I was capturing the live fingerprints, photograph, signature of the President and the Vice President of Ghana at the Castle (the seat of the presidency then). In the picuture are the CEO of Buck Press, Project Manager, Director of Passport, and other officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
